- 👋 Hi, I’m Kyle. It's an honor to introduce myself to you.
- 👀 I’m interested in improving my Powershell and Python, followed by AWS and Terraform fluencies to pave the way for Azure someday.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying to recertify on AWS SA but priorities are priorities am I right?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate once I'm established and I understand what I'm doing.
- 📫 How to reach me? My Discord is https://discord.gg/5S4JTuY8pw
